# Will-it-rain- üå¶Ô∏è

## Project Overview
"Will-it-rain-" is an interactive weather website that allows users to check the current weather of any city worldwide. It provides accurate information including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy. This project was developed for a hackathon with the goal of integrating APIs to deliver real-time weather data in a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Search for the weather of any city around the world.
- Display current temperature in multiple units (Celsius and Fahrenheit).
- Show humidity levels and wind speed.
- Provide textual description of weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snow, etc.).
- Simple and intuitive user interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for website structure.
- **CSS** for styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and API integration.
- **Weather API** (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch real-time weather data.

## How It Works
1. User enters the name of a city in the search bar.
2. The website sends a request to the Weather API.
3. The API returns real-time weather information.
4. JavaScript processes the data and displays it on the webpage.
5. User can see temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a short description of the weather condition.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to work with APIs and build a functional web application. It also provides a practical tool for users to quickly check weather conditions around the world.

## Future Improvements
- Add a 7-day weather forecast for each city.
- Include icons or animations representing different weather conditions.
- Add a geolocation feature to automatically show the weather of the user‚Äôs current location.
- Improve mobile responsiveness and design aesthetics.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser.  
3. Type a city name in the search bar and press Enter.  
4. View the weather information displayed on the page.
